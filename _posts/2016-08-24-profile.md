PROFILE

I am a passionate technologist and love programming since my father brought home an Oric Atmos, in 1991\.  
From 1998 to 2005, I studied mathematics, psychology, cognitive sciences, and developed artificial intelligence software for my research thesis.  
Then I co-founded Expert Research and worked on a wide range of software applications.  
In 2014, we sold one of our SaaS apps, used by a major insurance company in Morocco for processing automobile claims and car accidents' cost analysis, to a brand of Solera, the global leader in this industry.

Today, I am specializing in machine learning, and looking forward to the next steps.
