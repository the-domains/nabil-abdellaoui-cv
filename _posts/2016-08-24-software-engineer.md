### SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Client :[inwi, major telecom operator in Morocco][0]  
I was the architect of the Geographic Information System covering implantation studies, geo marketing, client eligibility issues, and georeporting.  
After collecting and cleaning data from all of inwi's IT ecosystem, we addressed some of the hottest business questions and challenges by building analytic and predictive products.  
I coached a team of five developers during 18 months, and we reached the goals of the project on time.

Client :[Fleet Performance, a brand of Orange Applications For Business][1]  
We redesigned the Fleet Performance application from PHP to Java and from MapServer to GeoServer, aiming more scalability and lower costs for future developments.  
We built, delivered and migrated the service without downtime.

Client :[Wafa Assurances, major insurance company in Morocco][2]  
Web interfaces and data analytics for processing automobile claims.  
We provided this solution - development, hosting and support - to Wafa Assurances during 8 years, and finally sold this baby to[a brand of Solera][3], the world's leader in this field.

Client :[Citron Vert][4]  
Franchise Point of Sale application  
This is a complete Point of Sale solution, plus business intelligence at the franchise level, that we provide as a service to a network of 80 beauty centers in France.  
Developed with MySql, Java and Flex, currently being replaced by Angular JS.
